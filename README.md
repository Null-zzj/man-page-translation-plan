## How do I contribute to Oh My Zsh?

如果想要加入该项目，请先阅读[贡献指南](CONTRIBUTING.md)

I'm far from being a [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) expert and suspect there are many ways to improve – if you have ideas on how to make the configuration easier to maintain (and faster), don't hesitate to fork and send pull requests!

We also need people to test out pull requests. So take a look through [the open issues](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues) and help where you can.

See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
